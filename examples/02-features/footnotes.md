# Footnotes Example

This document demonstrates footnote usage in Markdown.

## Basic Footnotes

Markdown supports footnotes[^1] that appear at the bottom of the document.

You can use footnotes to add citations[^2] or additional explanations[^3] without cluttering the main text.

## Multiple References

The same footnote can be referenced multiple times[^1].

## Inline vs Reference Style

This is an inline footnote marker[^4], and the actual content is defined elsewhere in the document.

## Long Footnotes

Footnotes can contain multiple paragraphs[^long] and even formatting.

## Footnote Definitions

[^1]: This is a simple footnote with plain text.

[^2]: Smith, J. (2024). *The Art of Documentation*. Tech Press.

[^3]: Additional context that would break the flow of the main narrative but is still valuable for readers who want more detail.

[^4]: Footnotes are automatically numbered and placed at the end of the document in Typst.

[^long]: This is a longer footnote that demonstrates multiple paragraphs.

    You can include **formatted text**, `code`, and even lists:
    
    - Item one
    - Item two
    - Item three
    
    This makes footnotes very versatile for academic writing.
